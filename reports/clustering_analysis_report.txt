CLUSTERING ANALYSIS REPORT - CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION
======================================================================
Generated: 2025-12-29 03:17:01
Method: K-Means Clustering with k=4
Total Customers: 5,881

1. CLUSTERING METHODOLOGY
----------------------------------------
Features used: Recency, Frequency, Monetary (log-transformed)
Preprocessing: Standardization (mean=0, std=1)
Optimal clusters: 4 (determined by elbow method & silhouette)
Algorithm: K-Means with random_state=42 for reproducibility

2. CLUSTER DISTRIBUTION

Dormant Customers (Cluster 1):
  • Customers: 1,866 (31.7%)
  • Avg Recency: 473.6 days
  • Avg Frequency: 1.9
  • Avg Monetary: £502.06

4. COMPARISON WITH RFM SEGMENTS
----------------------------------------
Machine Learning vs. Business Rules:

• Clustering finds natural groups in data
• RFM uses predefined business rules
• Combining both gives complete picture

5. VISUALIZATIONS CREATED
----------------------------------------
• reports/images/04_cluster_distribution.png - Cluster sizes & profiles
• reports/images/05_cluster_scatter.png - 2D cluster visualization

6. FILES GENERATED
----------------------------------------
• data/customer_clusters.csv - Complete clustering results
• data/cluster_profiles.csv - Cluster profiles with statistics
• reports/clustering_analysis_report.txt - This analysis report

7. NEXT STEPS
----------------------------------------
1. Create targeted campaigns for each cluster
2. Monitor cluster migration over time
3. A/B test marketing strategies per cluster
4. Integrate with CRM system for automated segmentation
